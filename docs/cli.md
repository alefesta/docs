# FuseML Command-Line Reference

Use FuseML Command-Line is a frictionless experience. Let's deep dive into the various option you may use with it.
Let's start looking at the whole capabilites. Simply type:

```bash
fuseml
```

you should get a similar output

```bash
FuseML command line client

Usage:
  fuseml [command]

Available Commands:
  application application management
  codeset     codeset management
  help        Help about any command
  runnable    runnable management
  version     display version information
  workflow    Workflow management

Flags:
  -h, --help          help for fuseml
      --timeout int   (FUSEML_HTTP_TIMEOUT) maximum number of seconds to wait for response (default 30)
  -u, --url string    (FUSEML_SERVER_URL) URL where the FuseML service is running
  -v, --verbose       (FUSEML_VERBOSE) print verbose information, such as HTTP request and response details

Use "fuseml [command] --help" for more information about a command.
```

## Application

FuseML application represent the various applications currently deployed over an instance of FuseML. Keep in mind that FuseML leverage the configuration file of your local kubeconfig so currently doesn't (yet) show an omni-comprensive view of all your instances.

The application sub-command has the following capabilites:

```bash
Perform operations on applications

Usage:
  fuseml application [command]

Available Commands:
  delete      Delete an application.
  get         Get an application.
  list        List applications.

Flags:
  -h, --help   help for application

Global Flags:
      --timeout int   (FUSEML_HTTP_TIMEOUT) maximum number of seconds to wait for response (default 30)
  -u, --url string    (FUSEML_SERVER_URL) URL where the FuseML service is running
  -v, --verbose       (FUSEML_VERBOSE) print verbose information, such as HTTP request and response details

Use "fuseml application [command] --help" for more information about a command.
```

## Codesets

FuseML Codeset represent the "link" between your local environment and the Git-a-like repository where you and your team is working
The application sub-command has the following capabilites:

```bash
Perform operations on codesets

Usage:
  fuseml codeset [command]

Available Commands:
  delete      Delete codesets.
  get         Get codesets.
  list        List codesets.
  register    Register codesets.

Flags:
  -h, --help   help for codeset

Global Flags:
      --timeout int   (FUSEML_HTTP_TIMEOUT) maximum number of seconds to wait for response (default 30)
  -u, --url string    (FUSEML_SERVER_URL) URL where the FuseML service is running
  -v, --verbose       (FUSEML_VERBOSE) print verbose information, such as HTTP request and response details

Use "fuseml codeset [command] --help" for more information about a command.
```

## Workflow

FuseML Workflow are the core of the client. Those are the link between your code (i.e.: the model prototyped) and the rest of your end-to-end pipeline. A workflow is made basically by two different components:

- the command line that register and later assign the workflow
- a workflow definition based on a "generic" yaml file

the workflow sub-command has the following capabilites:

```bash
Perform operations on workflows

Usage:
  fuseml workflow [command]

Available Commands:
  assign           Assigns a workflow to a codeset
  create           Creates a workflow
  delete           Deletes a workflow
  get              Get a workflow
  list             Lists one or more workflows
  list-assignments Lists one or more workflow assignments
  list-runs        Lists one or more workflow runs
  unassign         Unassign a workflow from a codeset

Flags:
  -h, --help   help for workflow

Global Flags:
      --timeout int   (FUSEML_HTTP_TIMEOUT) maximum number of seconds to wait for response (default 30)
  -u, --url string    (FUSEML_SERVER_URL) URL where the FuseML service is running
  -v, --verbose       (FUSEML_VERBOSE) print verbose information, such as HTTP request and response details

Use "fuseml workflow [command] --help" for more information about a command.
```

The YAML file is:

```yml

    inputs:
      - codeset:
          name: '{{ inputs.mlflow-codeset }}'
          path: /project
    outputs:

          path: '/project'
    outputs:

        value: "http://mlflow"
      - name: MLFLOW_S3_ENDPOINT_URL
        value: "http://mlflow-minio:9000"
      - name: AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
        value: < INSERT YOUR MINIO ACCESS KEY>
      - name: AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
        value: < INSERT YOUR MINIO SECRET KEY>
  - name: predictor
    image: ghcr.io/fuseml/kfserving-predictor:0.1
    inputs:
      - name: model
        value: '{{ steps.trainer.outputs.mlflow-model-url }}'
      - name: predictor
        value: '{{ inputs.predictor }}'
      - codeset:
          name: '{{ inputs.mlflow-codeset }}'
          path: '/project'
    outputs:
      - name: prediction-url
    env:
      - name: AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
        value: < INSERT YOUR MINIO ACCESS KEY>
      - name: AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
        value: < INSERT YOUR MINIO SECRET KEY>

```

---
**NOTE**

The values AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY may be retrieved easily with the below commands:

```bash
export ACCESS=$(kubectl get secret -n fuseml-workloads mlflow-minio -o json| jq -r '.["data"]["accesskey"]' | base64 -d)
export SECRET=$(kubectl get secret -n fuseml-workloads mlflow-minio -o json| jq -r '.["data"]["secretkey"]' | base64 -d)
```

Now replace the original values in the pipeline-01.yaml example. You can do it by editing the file manually or by running following command:

```bash
sed -i -e "/AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID/{N;s/value: [^ \t]*/value: $ACCESS/}" pipelines/pipeline-01.yaml
sed -i -e "/AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY/{N;s/value: [^ \t]*/value: $SECRET/}" pipelines/pipeline-01.yaml
```
